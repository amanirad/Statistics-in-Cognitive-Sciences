# Statistics-in-Cognitive-Sciences

The current repository for the final projects of the statistics course in cognitive sciences in the first semester of 2021 at Shahid Beheshti University (SBU). Five projects are defined here that all students should complete all five projects with full details in the same Jupyter Notebook R file related to that project (codes and descriptions-interpretations of the codes, as well as conclusions, should be carefully added together in that file). Data for each project is uploaded here. 

The deadline for these projects is Sunday, July 11, 2021, (20 Tir 1400) at 11:59 PM Tehran time and will not be extended in any way.

As soon as the projects are completed, please zip all five files of your project and send them to j.amanirad@gmail.com.
